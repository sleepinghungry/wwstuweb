        <h1>how will our new president, trump affect us at wilow wind?</h1>
            
        <p>Trump won the president. What do i think as an american citizen, privileged, white and a male? <br><br>
According to multiple tests i'm a republican, I would consider myself one. That does not mean i<br> agree with  Donald J Trump. If I was able to vote I would  most likely have voted for trump, though <br> that would not matter since I live in a strong democratic state, oregon. I think that trumps bigotry is <br> not a good representation for our country, but I’d rather have “jerk”  than a liar! </p>


<h2>Russia</h2>.
I think It's clear Trump is willing to figure out some of the problems we have between russia and <br> the usa. Also The russians and trump are doing their  best to resolve differences with the U.S. <br> over Russia's occupation of Crimea. There is much hate and protests around the word about<br> trump winning the election, but in russia about a third of the russians surveyed said that they<br> believe trump will be one of the greatest  us presidents. (according to USA today)


        <h3>The recount.</h3>
Jill Stein raises more funds for recount than entire presidential campaign.Jill stein, many clinton supporters and computer scientists say the the election is rigged, and “hacked”!  Just like what trump said in a lot of his speeches a debates.   Nominee jill stein has raise over 5.5 million dollars for a election recount. wisconsin has started to recount their votes.
Hacking is an abused word.hacking means to use a computer to gain unauthorized access to data in a system.
